'''
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

Extras:

    Keep the game going until the user types "exit"
    Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
